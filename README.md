## About Me

I am currently deepening my understanding of Git, open-source workflows, and front-end development.

My focus is on:
- Clean Git history and commit structure
- Proper fork management (origin / upstream)
- JavaScript architecture and refactoring
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Deployment workflows

I value clarity, structure, and reproducibility in development.
